## About

I built this solo project while learning essential HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts through Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Figma design was provided by Scrimba, the app was built from scratch by me.

In order to try making the app more unique and practice more, I had changed the color scheme of the provided Figma design, added a footer and added html pages with sort of a "coming soon" info message.

Having done my best in adhering to DRY principles, I had created a `common.js` file that takes care of rendering all html for the navbar, footer, and also the above mentioned info message on relevant pages.

I had also tried making the website somewhat responsive by displaying content as columns on smaller devices, and scaling down font and container sizes. I will be learning more about responsiveness and relative units in the upcoming weeks, somore work will be done in that area soon.

## Tools

The app was built with the help of these tools:

- [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - awesome `png` to `ico` generator
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - create your own color palette, or pick an existing one
- [FocoClipping](https://www.fococlipping.com/) - remove picture background. I used this tool to remove BestBank logo white background before generating a favicon for tab icon.
